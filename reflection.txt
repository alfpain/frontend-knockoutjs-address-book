		as I said in the previous storie solve it using the input to add to contacts who asked me and with all your info
	---As a user I must be able to delete contacts from my address book. and As a user I must be able to add and remove phone numbers to any individual contact
		as I said this storie so that aggregates was a remove button so that at any moment I could remove any contact and number phone
	---As a backend developer, I must receive all the address book contacts as a JSON so I can store it in a database
		use a function of knockout
self.save = function () {
         self.lastSavedJson (JSON.stringify (ko.toJS (self.contacts), null, 2));
     }; // Json Keeps and displays
 
     self.lastSavedJson = ko.observable ("")
